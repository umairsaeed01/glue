Automate workflows across scheduling, maintenance, fatigue and compliance
Build backend logic using n8n, Python, TypeScript or whatever fits the problem
Create small, practical AI tools to streamline decision making and reduce admin

Not just a number. Not just a cog. This is your chance to shape how data drives a business.

This business is on a significant growth curve.  New mines, new buildings, mergers, expansion. And a heap of operational data from Safety, People and the Field that needs a tech brain to bring it together and make it work.
It’s not a polished corporate machine. It’s dynamic, hands-on, constantly evolving, and they like it that way. The approach is fast, practical, and proudly strappy - more startup than status quo.
  
We’re looking for a Data Engineer who gets things done. Someone who can bring structure to chaos, who’s not afraid to roll up their sleeves, and who’s excited by the chance to build something from the ground up. You'll be working side by side with a Data Analyst, supporting the business with fast, functional, value-driven solutions.
  
You’ll be #5 coming into this growing Tech Team. This is a small crew with big reach, and plenty of freedom to influence how things get done.
  
If you’re waiting for a detailed project brief and a 10-step plan, this probably isn’t for you. But if you’re a builder, a fixer, a tech-savvy doer who thrives on autonomy and variety, keep reading.
  
  
What You’ll Be Doing:
Build and maintain data pipelines across real time, IoT and monthly reporting environments
Build and maintain a scalable data warehouse to support analytics, real time reporting, business insights and interactive dashboards
Turn strategy into action using the tech that fits best (agile, tech agnostic, and focused on outcomes)
Partner with stakeholders in Operations, Safety and People teams to understand what’s needed and then deliver it
Take ownership in a small, close-knit team and wear a few different hats along the way
Bring order, speed and smart solutions to a business that’s moving quickly
  
You’ll Bring:
Strong SQL and Python skills, and experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure
Familiarity with tools like AWS EMR, Glue, S3 and Kinesis
Ability to work independently, pivot when needed, and stay focused on outcomes
Energy, curiosity and a low ego, practical mindset
Bonus points for Operations Centre or IoT experience
  
What’s On Offer:
A genuinely autonomous role where your ideas are welcomed and your impact is visible
Freedom to design and build smart solutions that drive real business outcomes
A business that values simplicity, transparency and making a difference
You’ll be working in the Perth CBD office. This is a hands-on, on-site role where being close to the team and the tech makes all the difference
Occasional regional travel with the IT Manager
  
  
This is a newly created role. It’s not about maintaining what’s already built, it’s about building what’s needed.

Not just a number. Not just a cog. This is your chance to shape how data drives a business.

This business is on a significant growth curve.  New mines, new buildings, mergers, expansion. And a heap of operational data from Safety, People and the Field that needs a tech brain to bring it together and make it work.
It’s not a polished corporate machine. It’s dynamic, hands-on, constantly evolving, and they like it that way. The approach is fast, practical, and proudly strappy - more startup than status quo.
  
We’re looking for a Data Engineer who gets things done. Someone who can bring structure to chaos, who’s not afraid to roll up their sleeves, and who’s excited by the chance to build something from the ground up. You'll be working side by side with a Data Analyst, supporting the business with fast, functional, value-driven solutions.
  
You’ll be #5 coming into this growing Tech Team. This is a small crew with big reach, and plenty of freedom to influence how things get done.
  
If you’re waiting for a detailed project brief and a 10-step plan, this probably isn’t for you. But if you’re a builder, a fixer, a tech-savvy doer who thrives on autonomy and variety, keep reading.
  
  
What You’ll Be Doing:
Build and maintain data pipelines across real time, IoT and monthly reporting environments
Build and maintain a scalable data warehouse to support analytics, real time reporting, business insights and interactive dashboards
Turn strategy into action using the tech that fits best (agile, tech agnostic, and focused on outcomes)
Partner with stakeholders in Operations, Safety and People teams to understand what’s needed and then deliver it
Take ownership in a small, close-knit team and wear a few different hats along the way
Bring order, speed and smart solutions to a business that’s moving quickly
  
You’ll Bring:
Strong SQL and Python skills, and experience with cloud platforms such as AWS or Azure
Familiarity with tools like AWS EMR, Glue, S3 and Kinesis
Ability to work independently, pivot when needed, and stay focused on outcomes
Energy, curiosity and a low ego, practical mindset
Bonus points for Operations Centre or IoT experience
  
What’s On Offer:
A genuinely autonomous role where your ideas are welcomed and your impact is visible
Freedom to design and build smart solutions that drive real business outcomes
A business that values simplicity, transparency and making a difference
You’ll be working in the Perth CBD office. This is a hands-on, on-site role where being close to the team and the tech makes all the difference
Occasional regional travel with the IT Manager
  
  
This is a newly created role. It’s not about maintaining what’s already built, it’s about building what’s needed.
If that sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you.",,,,MakeItHappen_resume.pdf,MakeItHappen_coverletter.pdf,,,

Digging into SEO, Paid Media (PPC + Paid Social), Organic Social, and a bit of automation and WordPress
Reporting on campaigns, making optimisations, doing audits — basically, getting your hands dirty
Working with our Aussie-based Delivery team to make sure stuff gets done, properly
Using tools like Google Ads, Analytics, Facebook, LinkedIn, Insta — the usual suspects
Scheduling and posting social content, editing reels and TikToks, pulling insights, and actioning ideas
Managing time, tasks, and expectations like a pro (or learning how to fast)
What we’re not expecting:
You to be a digital unicorn from day one
What we are expecting:
You to be keen to learn, curious enough to question, and switched-on enough to give a damn
You’ll do well here if you:
Don’t leave stuff to the last minute
Aren’t scared to ask questions
Hit your deadlines and own it when you don’t
Actually care about the quality of your work
Want to grow — and not just to look good on LinkedIn
Can take feedback without falling apart
Our values (we live by them):
Be genuine
Practice excellence
Be courageous
Be curious
Communicate well
Enjoy yourself
If you’re after a big title, office ping pong, or fluff-filled job ads, this probably isn’t the place for you. But if you want to do real work with good people who value honesty and effort, then we’d like to meet you.
Apply now. Let’s see what you’ve got.",,,,3By2_resume.pdf,3By2_coverletter.pdf,,,

Hey, g'day, mabuhay, kia ora,你好, hallo, vítejte!
Thanks for stopping by. We know job hunting can be a little time consuming and you're probably keen to find out what's on offer, so we'll get straight to the point. 
Where and how you can work
Our flagship campus is in Sydney. We also have a campus in Melbourne and co-working spaces in Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. But you have choice in where and how you work. That means if you want to do your thing in the office (if you're near one), at home or a bit of both, it's up to you. 
What you’d be doing in this role
As Canva scales change continues to be part of our DNA. But we like to think that's all part of the fun. So this will give you the flavour of the type of things you'll be working on when you start, but this will likely evolve.
At the moment, this role is focused on:
Play a leading role in defining the technical roadmap and architecture for the services powering our internal platforms for product decisioning. Advocate for best practices that enhance service performance, resilience, and adaptability.
Establish yourself as an expert in developing platforms that facilitate decision-making while being deeply integrated with the company's data ecosystem.

Provide guidance and mentorship to other engineers, assisting them in their professional development and helping them navigate technical challenges.
Have a widespread impact across the organization by facilitating and orchestrating cross-team initiatives that set a higher standard for reliability, velocity, and security.
You're probably a match if you have:
Extensive experience developing distributed web applications on the JVM, with a deep understanding of Java (other JVM languages like Scala or Kotlin are a plus, though we primarily use Java 17).
A track record of successfully planning and executing complex architectural changes, with a strong focus on creative problem-solving rather than reliance on specific frameworks or libraries.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills, both written and verbal, with the ability to foster a positive working environment across stakeholders and engineers.
Proven experience mentoring and guiding engineering teams, unblocking technical challenges, and serving as a role model.
Mastery of computer science and engineering fundamentals such as concurrency, data structures, and distributed systems, along with a strong grasp of resiliency techniques like load balancing, throttling, back pressure, and circuit breaking.
Hands-on experience working in large distributed cloud environments (AWS preferred) and familiarity with cloud-native technologies such as Kubernetes and Terraform.
Bonus: Experience with large-scale distributed data processing systems (e.g., Snowflake, Clickhouse) and expertise in SQL and data modeling best practices.
Nice to have:

Understanding the concept of AB testing and experimentation
Experience in full-stack development
