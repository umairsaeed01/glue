## 1. Introduction:
### 1.1. Our Proposal
We're aiming to create a automated system that makes applying for jobs a breeze. Job hunting has many stages, and we see a chance to automate things and use LLM (Language Model) to make it even smoother. We're looking at different ways, both the usual and some new ideas, to integrate LLM into the job application process. The goal is to reduce how much you have to do and let LLM do its thing, making the whole process easier for you.

### 1.3. Refer to this [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06221) for more details.

## 2. Setup, Installation and Usage
### 2.1. Prerequisites
 - OS : Linux, Mac
 - Python : 3.11.6 and above
 - LLM API key: [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) OR [Gemini Pro](https://ai.google.dev/)

### 2.2. Package Installation - Use as Library

```bash
pip install zlm
```

 - Usage

```python
from zlm import AutoApplyModel

job_llm = AutoApplyModel(
    api_key="PROVIDE_API_KEY", 
    provider="ENTER PROVIDER <gemini> or <openai>",
    downloads_dir="[optional] ENTER FOLDER PATH WHERE FILE GET DOWNLOADED, By default, 'downloads' folder"
)

job_llm.resume_cv_pipeline(
    "ENTER_JOB_URL", 
    "YOUR_MASTER_RESUME_DATA" # .pdf or .json
) # Return and downloads curated resume and cover letter.
```

### 2.4. Setup & Run Code - Use as Project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ztrimus/job-llm.git
cd job-llm
```
 1. Create and activate python environment (use `python -m venv .env` or conda or etc.) to avoid any package dependency conflict.
 2. Install [Poetry package](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/) (dependency management and packaging tool)
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```
 3. Install all required packages.
     - Refer [pyproject.toml](pyproject.toml) or [poetry.lock](poetry.lock) for list of packages.
        ```bash
        poetry install
        ```
        OR
     - If above command not working, we also provided [requirements.txt](resources/requirements.txt) file. But, we recommend using poetry.
        ```bash
        pip install -r resources/requirements.txt
        ```
4. We also need to install following packages to conversion of latex to pdf
    - For linux
        ```bash
        sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra
        ```
        NOTE: try `sudo apt-get update` if terminal unable to locate package.
    - For Mac
        ```bash
        brew install basictex
        sudo tlmgr install enumitem fontawesome
        ```
5. If you want to run ollama models
    ```sh
    ollama pull llama3.1
    ```
6. Run following script to get result
```bash
>>> python main.py /
    --url "JOB_POSTING_URL" /
    --master_data="JSON_USER_MASTER_DATA" /
    --api_key="YOUR_LLM_PROVIDER_API_KEY" / # put api_key considering provider
    --downloads_dir="DOWNLOAD_LOCATION_FOR_RESUME_CV" /
    --provider="openai" # openai, gemini
```
