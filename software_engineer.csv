As scientific advances are generating ever increasing volumes of data, new tools are needed to efficiently mine, integrate and analyse this information to support data-driven research. Agriculture Victoria Research is addressing this need by developing intuitive open-source web-based tools that allow scientists to explore and analyse complex datasets without requiring specialist skills. However, the increasing scale and complexity of data presents a significant challenge: keeping up with it. This position will apply AI techniques such as large language models and knowledge graphs to help plant breeders and researchers navigate datasets and identify information most relevant to their needs. By improving access to data, you will support data-driven research and accelerate the development of improved grain varieties for Australian growers.
You will work in a multidisciplinary team of research scientists, data scientists and software developers to develop open-source tools that allow users to search and connect with data using plain language, without needing to understand where or how it is stored. You will contribute significantly to project delivery, both independently and as part of a team, and play a key role in communicating outputs to a wide range of stakeholders and reporting on project progress.
You will be highly motivated, with strong interpersonal, organisational and communication skills, both verbal and written. You will work effectively in a multidisciplinary team as well as independently. You will have strong programming skills (Python, R or similar) and demonstrated experience with AI-based approaches such as large language models and knowledge graphs. You will also have experience with graph databases (e.g. Neo4j), web front-end frameworks and APIs, and a working knowledge of high-performance computing environments and code management tools such as Git. Your skills will allow you to work comfortably across the full software development pipeline, from design through to deployment and adoption.
The position offers a unique opportunity to join a forward-thinking team that is transforming how plant scientists and breeders interact with data. The position is based at AgriBio - a state-of-the-art biosciences research centre - within the Plant Sciences branch, which includes 65+ scientists and technical staff specialising in plant genetic resources, crop genetic improvement, genomics and bioinformatics.
