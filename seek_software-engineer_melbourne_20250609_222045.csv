By improving access to data, you will support data-driven research and accelerate the development of improved grain varieties for Australian growers.
You will work in a multidisciplinary team of research scientists, data scientists and software developers to develop open-source tools that allow users to search and connect with data using plain language, without needing to understand where or how it is stored. You will contribute significantly to project delivery, both independently and as part of a team, and play a key role in communicating outputs to a wide range of stakeholders and reporting on project progress.
You will be highly motivated, with strong interpersonal, organisational and communication skills, both verbal and written.

You will have strong programming skills (Python, R or similar) and demonstrated experience with AI-based approaches such as large language models and knowledge graphs. You will also have experience with graph databases (e.g. Neo4j), web front-end frameworks and APIs, and a working knowledge of high-performance computing environments and code management tools such as Git. Your skills will allow you to work comfortably across the full software development pipeline, from design through to deployment and adoption.
The position offers a unique opportunity to join a forward-thinking team that is transforming how plant scientists and breeders interact with data. The position is based at AgriBio - a state-of-the-art biosciences research centre - within the Plant Sciences branch, which includes 65+ scientists and technical staff specialising in plant genetic resources, crop genetic improvement, genomics and bioinformatics.
