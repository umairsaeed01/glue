Not just a cog. Not just a coder. This is your chance to bring automation and AI into the heart of corporate and operational decision making.
  
The corporate environment is polished and professional, structured where it counts. But the Tech team? We are small, hands on, and proudly strappy. Think fewer layers, more action. More startup than status quo.

We are looking for someone who gets things done. Someone who is excited to build tools that replace spreadsheets, manual tasks and double handling with smart automation and backend logic. You will be solving real problems for real users, every day, from the boardroom to the operations centre.
  
This is not your typical RPA role. While experience with tools like UiPath or Automation Anywhere is a bonus, we are more focused on fast, API driven automation using n8n, Python and TypeScript. Flexible, lightweight and fit for purpose.
  
If you are looking for a place where automation and AI are more than buzzwords, and where your work has visible impact, keep reading.
  
What You Will Be Doing
Automate workflows across scheduling, maintenance, fatigue and compliance
Build backend logic using n8n, Python, TypeScript or whatever fits the problem
Create small, practical AI tools to streamline decision making and reduce admin
Integrate systems through APIs, file exchanges and direct data connections
Own your tools from prototype to production, with clear logging and documentation
Work directly with internal users to train, support and refine your solutions
  
What You Will Bring
Experience in automation, backend development or systems integration
Knowledge of RPA tools such as UiPath or Automation Anywhere is welcome but not essential
Strong skills in Python, JavaScript or TypeScript, or similar scripting languages
Comfortable working with APIs, operational platforms and legacy systems
A strong interest in AI tooling and a practical approach to using it
Clear communicator with a low ego and a focus on real outcomes

A newly created role with room to shape how automation and AI are applied across the business
Real world impact, your work sits at the heart of both corporate and operations
Hands on, on site role based in the Perth CBD tech hub
A collaborative environment that values transparency, simplicity and momentum
Occasional regional travel with the IT Manager
